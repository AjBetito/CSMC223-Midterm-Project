# CSMC223-Midterm-Project

This is made by Elijah Carl G. Betito and Evann Anthony Francis Bellen as compliance for the CSMC223 Midterm Project.

The program only needs to be run, but if you wish to add more, you may go to "input.txt" and add your instructions. The syntax reads as follows:

**[OPCODE | NUMBER | REGISTER]**
ex.
LOAD 1 GR[2]
ADD 2 GR[1]
PRINT 0 GR[3]
